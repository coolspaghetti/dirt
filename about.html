		<p class="about-movie"><h3>About Joe Dirt</h3>"Joe Dirt" is a "comedy" "adventure" movie released in 2001, starring David Spade.<br/> It was written by Spade and Fred Wolf and had Adam Sandler's Happy Madison company produce it (an idicator of great quality).<br/><br/> If you haven't seen it yet, the movie revolves around a young white-trash guy called Joe Dirt.<br/>He tells his story on a radio show and becomes a media sensation.<br/> Listeners are rooting for him to fulfil his quest of finding his parents whom he lost at The Grand Canyon.<br/><br/>To me it's the only movie where David Spade doesn't play a little bitch (Tommy Boy, Black Sheep) or some<br/> desperate playboy ladies-man (Grown Ups, Rules of Engagement) but rather a sweet and wholesome character.<br/> You empathize with Joe Dirt and want him to win in the end.</p>
        <p class="about-project"><h3>About the project</h3>When I first saw the movie "Joe Dirt" I thought to myself man, those are some really cool clothes. <br/>I wanted to create a lookbook or something similar but never pursued the idea. <br/>About a year later, while slowly regaining interest in the movie and the web dev department I started thinking of this.<br/>The project uses HTML and CSS by me and JavaScript written with the help of ChatGPT(I'm not able to really do it myself yet)<br/>For the artwork I used Procreate on the iPad Pro with the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil. <br/>Also, since I mostly create realistic-looking portraits of people, doing this more cartoony style was a challenge for me and I'm happy with how it looks. <br/>
        As of now the project took probably more than 20h (16h for the art).</p>
