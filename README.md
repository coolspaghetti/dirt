# dirt
dress up "game" for the titular character of 2001 movie "Joe Dirt"\
it's only intended for fullscreen at the moment (will work on that in the future)


## what i want to work on
- better style
- reset button
- better landing page
- better about page
- 'add dirt' button
- better responsiveness
- more artwork (more choices)
- maybe make windows with choices extendable
- "loading screen" mimic


## current issues
- some art kind of clips or is not adjusted to the others
